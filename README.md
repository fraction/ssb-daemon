# SSB-Daemon

SSB-Daemon (SSBD) is an experimental alternative to SSB-Server.

## Example

After installing, start it from the command-line.

```shell
ssb-daemon
```

## Installation

First, you'll need Node.js and npm on your computer. Run `node --version` to see if you have it. If not, or if it's older than the [**current** or **active LTS** version](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/), you should [download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) first.

Then, install SSB-Daemon:

```shell
npm install -g fraction/ssb-daemon
```

This pairs well with SSB-CLI:

```
npm install -g ssb-cli
```
